Mspacman is a makepkg and pacman wrapper/helper.
It accepts several flags that define its' behavior and passes most of the work
to the makepkg and pacman programs. As of right now, mspacman is only
performing limited functions:
    -search both the package database and AUR
    -grab tarballs from the AUR
    -create and install packages from tarballs
    -install from package database via pacman

There is currently no dependency checking, but it will be implemented in the
future as that was a prime motivation for the creation of this tool.

The currenly supported flags are:
    -I  install package according to the following modifiers
        l   local tarball or PKGBUILD file
        r   grab tarball and install from AUR
        p   offically supported package (pacman -S)
    
    -S  search for package or PKGBUILD
        a   AUR
        p   official package database
        b   search both
